======================
Adding an API Endpoint
======================

Currently, we have a service that returns playing cards.
We can call this service from a script, and return the result in a workflow.

Now, let's add an API endpoint that calls the service.

There are two steps in the process; defining the endpoint, and adding the Python code to support it.
